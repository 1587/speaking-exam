成功是否需要冒险


My answer:

```
Yes, I think the success of a project requires risks.
firstly: Opportunities always come with risks, and if we don't take any risks, we don't have any opportunity to success. 
secondly: Risk means challenge, I like challenge, challenge makes the team stronger.
thirdly:  I've led a lot of projects, every project has risks, you need to resolve them and you'll have great success.
That's my views. 
So don't be afraid of the risks.
```
