如果你可以改变你们国家的图书馆，你想改变哪一件事，为什么？

My answer:

```
If I have a chance to change the library, I would add online reading function. 
There are some advantages as follows. 
Firstly : we can access the library at any time in any place. 
That would be convenient. secondly: we need not drive to the library, that will save our time. 
Thirdly: we wil search books quickly,we can find book as soon as possible. 
Finally: ebook is cheep , that will save much money for the country.
Therefor, I suggest add the library online reading function to National Library.
