There are some advantages as follows. 
Firstly: we can access the library at any time in any place. 
secondly: we need not drive to the library, that will save our time. 
Thirdly: we will search books quickly, that would be very convenient.
Finally: e-book is cheaper, that will save much money for the country.
So, I suggest add the library online reading function to National Library.
