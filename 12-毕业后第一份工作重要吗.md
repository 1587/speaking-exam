有些人觉得人毕业后的第一份工作对他或她的后续职业有很大影响，你认可还是不认可，为什么？

My answer:

```
I don't think so. There are some reasons to support my option.
Firstly, the most important thing for your career is the job that's right for you, not the first job, maybe the second one, the third one.
Secondly, when I was an interviewer, I did not care about the interviewee's first job, I just care about their last job and their Work experience.
Thirdly, people often change their jobs nowadays. If you don't like you first job, you should change it as soon as possible. it is nothing.
