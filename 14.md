你认为学生在长假期应该去公司里实习吗，为什么。
According to my personal experience, I think that the students should go to company for internship during the long holiday as the following reasons:
Firtly, students can enhance their knowledge about the new techonology. For example, in my corporation. We can learn many knowledge in 5G telecom field.
Secondly. According to this method, students can improver their abilitys about communication. That is very important for us. At present. no project can be completed only by oneself. And communication can make the problem be solved very quickly.
To be reasons above, my preference is definatedly for joining the work in a company before gradated.
