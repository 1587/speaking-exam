选择家具，什么因素factor最重要？.三个选项style/comfort/Materials

My answer:

```
The oldest furniture in my house is my sofa. I bought it five years ago. it is very comfortable, I use it very day, I like it very much.

Yes, I need to buy a new chair, my current chair is broken last week. I considered buying a ergonomic chair to reduce back and neck pain. 

I think the comfort of furniture is the most important thing.
Uncomfortable furniture can lower your quality of life and make you feel bad. You'll often feel like you've wasted money
Uncomfortable furniture is bad for our health, such as beds/chairs/tables, we use them every day.
So, comfort is the most important factor in choosing furniture.
