一生在家乡长大的人的优势是啥

My answer:

```
I lived in my hometown for 18 years (when I was born in a small village in Anhui Province). 
I left my hometown about ten years ago when I needed to go to college.

Many people leave their hometown for many reasons, such as work/study/business. 
I left my hometown for the education, there is no university in my hometown.

People who have always lived in their hometown will easy to work and study.
Because they live with their families, old friends and relatives who will help them when they meet difficulties in life.
that feels very good and that will save many money and time.
They know everything and everyone in their hometown very well.
So it's easier to succeed if they always lived in their hometown.

### 2.5 part5（11）(60)
你认为在就职一份新工作时   work hard willingness 还是 colleague communicate well更重要？-努力工作的意识和跟人相处、协作能力哪个更重要

My answer1:

```
I think colleague communicate well is the most important. there are some reasons as follows:

Firstly, good communication enable us to express our views clearly, and share our true thoughts with our colleagues. 
we can find out the root cause of the problem through communication.

Secondly, good communication enable us to think about other people's points of view, 
we can find our misstakes, which could be a risk of our project failture.  it is very important for our work. 

Finally, good communication can make team members feel better, which can makes our work efficiently.
We don't blame each other, we don't fight. Teams are more likely to succeed.

(Last week, for example, two of my co-workers didn't communicate well, they communicated over and over, 
and their attention was focused on who was causing the problem;
A said that B did not follow the process, and B said that A did not have the execution capability.
In the end, the problem was not resolved.)

The above reasons are why I think colleague communicate well is the most important.
