### 10.5	part5（11）(60)
问自己有一套房子或者公寓与租房的相比缺点是什么
买房子对比租房子的缺点，并描述认为是缺点的理由。

My answer:
``` 
I think buy a house will lowers the quality of life
Firstly, the price of real estate is too high, it will cost much money. 
Then we have enough money for learning skills, traveling.

Secondly, I often change my office location, it's not convenient to buy a house to work. 
It will waste much time to go to work, so It's better to rent.

You need to maintain the house every year, it's a waste of time and money.

That's my point. That’s all.
```

My answer2:
```
I think having a house or a department has the following disadvantages compared to renting:
First of all, housing is fixed in one place, cannot be changed at any time, 
But rental location can be changed with our work place, making our work life more convenient.

Secondly, the economic pressure of housing is high, the quality of life is low. 
You know, in China, a house needs several million RMB, and you have to pay off the loan every month, 
but the monthly rent is far less than the monthly mortgage [ˈmɔːɡɪdʒ].

Therefore, I like to rent a house, which can let my life without stress, and the mood happy.

not the first job, maybe the second one, the third one.

Secondly: When I was an interviewer, I did not care about the interviewee's first job,

you should change it as soon as possible. (it is nothing.)

There are three reasons.

and have a good comprehension of their job responsibility. 
Secondly, working independently is also a necessary ability,
actually we can't expect to rely on others’ help for everything. 
And finally, working independently will help them to build a resilient ability against work pressure. 
Therefore, it’s important to teach new employees how to work independently.
