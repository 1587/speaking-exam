### 23.4	Part5 （60）新员工培养哪个重要
新员工培养，自己独立上手，还是 老员工帮忙辅导

I think the best way for training new employees is to teach them how to work independently. There are three reasons.
Firstly, working independently will make them learn work skills quickly and have a good comprehension of their job responsibility. 
Secondly, working independently is also a necessary ability, actually we can't expect to rely on others’ help for everything. 
And finally, working independently will help them to build a resilient ability against work pressure. 
Therefore, it’s important to teach new employees how to work independently.
