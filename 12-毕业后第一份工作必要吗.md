有些人觉得人毕业后的第一份工作对他或她的后续职业有很大影响，你认可还是不认可，为什么？
Yes , I think the first job is the most important.there are several reasons to support my opinions.
Firstly, the first job is an important resume in our career. When others evaluate us, it is often the first job as our starting point.Secondly, many people choose their first job and will do the same job for the rest of their lives. If the first job is good, then our career path will be smooth. Last but not least, if we have been in a job for a few years, the opportunity cost of re-choice is too high and we have less time to choose.
