### 18.5	part5（11）(60)
如果两个人在项目中出现分歧是要解决或是忽略？

My answer:

```
Yes, Of course, disagreements need to be resolved.

Firstly: The disagreements mean that there is still some information unclear, which could be a project risk.

Secondly: Not to resolve disagreements will slow down the progress of the project. we can’t meet the deadline, which means the project will fail.

Thirdly: Project members must have the same goals. cooperation is the key to success.

These are the reasons why disagreements must be resolved.
(We can resolve any disagreements through communication)
