老师是否应该禁止学生带电子 设备 手机 电脑到教室？为什么？

My answer:

Firstly, Students should focus on study and learn more knowledge. Listen to the teacher carefully in class.
Secondly, It is easy for students to play games with electronic devices, which wastes more time for them.
Thirdly, electronic device is harmful to the students’ eyes. Many students will have poor eyesight.
finally, There is a lot of bad knowledge on the Internet, students have no ability to identify it.
The above reasons are why the electronic device should be forbidden.
