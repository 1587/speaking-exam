有钱就会快乐吗？请给出理由。

My answer:

```
No, I don't think so.  Money doesn't mean happiness
firstly: For example, friendship can make people happy, but money can't buy real friendship.
secondly: Sometimes, too much money makes you unhappy,  You will lose direction in life.
thirdly: You will spend more time earning money and you will have less time to enjoy life.
so,  We are happy, not because of money. (We don't live for money. Money is not everything.)
```
