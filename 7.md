老师是否应该禁止学生带电子设备-手机 电脑到教室？为什么？
Teachers should prohibit students taking electronic device to the classroom , due to the following three reasons
Firstly, students should focus on their studies, spend no more time on these devices. 
Secondly, even the students do not use smart phone or something else, it still distract students from study. 
Lastly, electronic device do harm to the students’ eyes and health.
So electronic device must be forbidden
