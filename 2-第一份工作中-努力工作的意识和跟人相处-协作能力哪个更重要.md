Firstly, there will be many new things need to learn for a new job, we must work hard. 
Secondly, it takes time to adjust to new colleagues and new jobs. This also needs to work hard.
Lastly, work hard is always the right way to be a good employee, whatever new jobs or old jobs.

I have worked for many years and I always work hard.
