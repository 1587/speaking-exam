I lived in my hometown for 18 years when I was borned in a small village in Anhui Province.
I leave my hometown while i was in university.

Many people leave their hometown for many reasons, such as work and study. 
I leave my hometown for the education, There is no university school in my hometown

People who have always lived in their hometown will easy to work and study, 
they can live with their families and many old friends, that feels very good.

I think young people need to understand the outside world. To learn new skills and new knowledge.
