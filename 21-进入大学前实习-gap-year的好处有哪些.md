Let me think. My last tour was in Nanjing, China last year. It is a very beautiful city.

I choose group tour, because it is cheaper and convenient, the guide of the tour will arrange many activities and lead us to enjoy the tour. 
I can talk about the tour with the member of group.  the travel agency help us booking the hotel , arrange the transport , theat would save my time and money.

If I go on a tour, tour guide is the most important. 

the guide will arrange many activities, lead us to enjoy the tour;
I can get professional knowledge about the city and study some new skills from the tour guide.
I will have more time to enjoy the landscape and have more time to take photos , eating tasty foods and so on.
so, the tour guide help us very well.

有兄弟认为：你认为高中生毕业后，在进入大学前 参加实习 有哪些好处
也有认为是：如果高中毕业搞一年gap year，好处是什么
 
My answer:

``` 
Yes, of cause.  student should have a gap year. There are some advantages as follows.

Firstly: You can get job experience in advance. then You will know clearly what you need to learn in college. 
(You will focus on learning that knowledge)

Secondly: You can learn things that you can't study in school. (You know more than your classmates. )
You'll be better than your classmates.

Thirdly:  With the gap year, we can learn a new language or experience a new culture.

At last, you can earn money through gap year, then you can buy more equipment or online classes to improve your learning.

So, I think a gap year is a better way to improve themselves.
