你认为解决问题的能力，还是沟通能力，还有组织能力（organization skills），三个能力中哪个能力是最重要的，为什么？
I think communication skills are the most important for the following reasons:
First of all, communication skills enable us to express our views clearly and share our views with others
Secondly, people with strong communication skills often have high Eq. they can make others feel happy and work efficiently
Finally, a person who is not good at communication is generally difficult to be understood, and everyone can't know his real thoughts
Therefore,  I think communication skills are more important
