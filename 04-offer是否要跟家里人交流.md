### 4.3	part3（5~7）(15+15+30)
1. 你上次买电脑是什么时候，为什么买？
2. 你觉得电脑在线上卖的多还是线下卖的多？
3. 你觉得电脑最重要的是什么?

My answer:

```
I bought my computer over internet on the August last year, because the old one is broken, so I must buy a new one.my son need a computer to do some online learning.

I think computers are more sold online, because the price is cheaper online
and I can easily get more information about the computer.



I think the most important thing is the quality.
firstly, if the computer often broken，a lot of people can’t work efficiently, that will waste much time.
secondly, our important information is store in the computer, if the computer often broken, we will waste many information.
(you know, time and information are so expensive, so I think quality is the most important thing of computer.)

### 4.5	part5（11）(60)
大题：如果你接到一个工作offer，你会和家里人family members 商量吗？ 和家人讨论的优点是什么？

My answer(需要重新梳理):

```
According my personal experience, If I have a new offer, I will discuss with my family members, 
There are some advantages as follows:

Firstly: My parents have 20 years of working experience, 
they can help me recognize the weaknesses and the advantages of my new job.

Secondly: Change a jobs is a big deal for a family. 
I must make good communications with them, they will feel better, we must respect each other.

Thirdly: With family member's support we will work efficiently.

So I think we must discuss with my family members when I have a new offer.
```

My answer2:

```
The advantages are as follows:
Firstly, my family especially my parents have worked many years, 
they have rich experience to give me some advice and help me make the right choice.

Secondly, My family knows me best, they are very clear what I'm good at and where my weakness lies in, 
so I can make sure whether the offer is suitable for me.

Finally, I think it is a respect to discuss the offer with them, they can feel valued, 
which is benefical to build the harmonious atmosphere in the family.

All the above are my opinions.
