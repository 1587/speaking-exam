### 10.5	part5（11）(60)
问自己有一套房子或者公寓与租房的相比缺点是什么
买房子对比租房子的缺点，并描述认为是缺点的理由。

My answer:
``` 
I think buy a house will lowers the quality of life
Firstly, the price of real estate is too high, it will cost much money. 
Then we have enough money for learning skills, traveling.

Secondly, I often change my office location, it's not convenient to buy a house to work. 
It will waste much time to go to work, so It's better to rent.

You need to maintain the house every year, it's a waste of time and money.

That's my point. That’s all.
```

My answer2:
```
I think having a house or a department has the following disadvantages compared to renting:
First of all, housing is fixed in one place, cannot be changed at any time, 
But rental location can be changed with our work place, making our work life more convenient.

Secondly, the economic pressure of housing is high, the quality of life is low. 
You know, in China, a house needs several million RMB, and you have to pay off the loan every month, 
but the monthly rent is far less than the monthly mortgage [ˈmɔːɡɪdʒ].

Therefore, I like to rent a house, which can let my life without stress, and the mood happy.
```


My answer3:

```
There are some disadvantages of buying a house. 

Firstly, buying and maintaining a house costs a lot of money. 
Because house is very expensive to buy.
Besides, you have to decorate the house, buy furniture and many other things.

Secondly, it is difficult to move to different locations if you own a house. 
If you need to change your job, you need to move to a new location. But if you own a house, you can’t do that. 

So I think these are the disadvantages of buying a house.
