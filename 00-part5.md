政府为所有学生承担大学课程费用的好处，举例支撑你的观点：
The advantages of pay the cost of university course for all students, pls give some examples to support it.
提供免费大学教育的优点包括：
首先，免费大学可以降低学生的债务，将使每一个学生都有机会上大学，无论学生的父母有多少钱。 这将有助于为低收入背景的学生加油打气。
此外，该国的整体教育水平可能会提高，从而使国家变得更好。
建议先明确一个论点，比如，减轻学生的经济负担，或学生的资金将可以更灵活地应用在学习中：一，钱可以用来买更高效先进的学习设备提升效率，比如PAD等；二，可以改善有经济压力（economical stressful）的学生经济状况，将更多的精力用于学习……

My answer:

```
if the government pay the cost of university courses for all students,
the quality of the country's education will be improved.

i have some reasons as follows:

firstly: students will have more money to buy learning equipment,
such as ipad, computer or smartphone. 
they will study efficiently.

secondly: students will focus on their study,
they don't worry about the money and don't spend much time on part-time job.
they will have more time to learn knowledge.

thirdly/ˈθɜːrdli/: It gives everyone a chance to go to college, 
no matter his family is poor or rich.
The more people go to college,
the stronger the country will be and it's education will develop fast.

All the above are my opinions.

问自己有一套房子或者公寓与租房的相比缺点是什么
买房子对比租房子的缺点，并描述认为是缺点的理由。

My answer:
``` 
I think buy a house will  reduce the quality of my life.
I have some reasons as follows:
Firstly, in china, the Housing price is too high, buy a house will cost too much money. 
(I will have no enough money for education, travel, medical care, and take care of my parents. )
I will be a mortgage/ˈmɔːɡɪdʒ/ slave.

Secondly, if I change my office to a place far from the house.
I will spend more time on commute, (Especially when I move to another city.)
it's not convenient.

(thirdly, I need to maintain the house every year, I also have to pay building taxes/ˈbɪldɪŋ ˈtæksɪz/;
it's a waste of money and time.)

finally, if the neighbors/'nebəz/ are not good, i can't replace them. 
so I think, renting a house is a good choice.
all the above are my opinions.

有些人觉得人毕业后的第一份工作对他或她的后续职业有很大影响，你认可还是不认可，为什么？

My answer:

```
I don't think so. There are some reasons as follows.

Firstly: The most important thing for your career is the job that's right for you, 
not the first job, maybe the second one, the third one.

Secondly: When I was an interviewer, I did not care about the interviewee's first job,
I just care about their last job and their Work experience.

Thirdly: People often change their jobs nowadays. If you don't like you first job, 
you should change it as soon as possible. (it is nothing.)

(For example, When I graduated from college. My first job wasn't very good. 
I just switched jobs, and now I'm doing really well.)

For the above reasons, I think the first job is not that important.

### 13.5	part5（11）(60)
当你获得一个公司的offer时，你是否同意需要考虑这个公司的reputation

``` 
I think we need to think about the reputation of the company.

Firstly: If a company has a good reputation, 
it will have more business opportunities. Opportunity means money. 
(the company could provide a very good slary for the staff.)

Secondly: (If a company has a good reputation,) the employees will grow in the long run. 
then, company will develop very well. Become bigger and bigger.

Thirdly: If a company has a bad reputation, its employees won't be loyal to it. 
(they will leave the company one by one.) Sooner or later it will go bankrupt.

So, I think companies should do a lot to build a good reputation.

```







### 15.5	part5（11）(60)
成功是否需要冒险

My answer:

```
Yes, I think the success of a project requires risk. 

Opportunity is always accompanied by risk, 
if we don't take any risk, we won't have any chance of success.
and risk also means challenge, challenge makes the team stronger.

I have led many projects, every project has risks, you need to solve them, you will achieve great success. 
for example ,Microsoft,Apple,Google,these great companies have taken many big risks and achieved great success.

So don't be afraid to take risks.

```

My answer:

```
Yes, I think the success of a project requires risks. I have following reasons: 
Firstly, if we want to succeed, we need to try new methods. 
But when we try new things, we need to take risks. 
For example, when I was developing a new program, I wanted to try a new way,
but I was afraid that my boss wouldn’t like it. 
However, I took the risk and tried. In the end, I made a great success. 
Secondly, taking more risks will make the team stronger. 
Because of risks, team members will be stronger and more resilient. 
A stronger team has more chance of winning. 
So, I think the success of a project requires risks.

有钱就会快乐吗？请给出理由。

My answer:

```
No, I don't think so, we are happy, not because of money.
Think about the past. When I was young, I had no money but I was very happy, 
I had many classmates, many friends, many time, no troubles.
so,we can see, for example, friendship make people happy, 
but money can't buy real friendship.

and to have more money, 
you must spend much time makeing money, have less time enjoying life.
in china, many software engineer work more than 12 hours a day
to maintain a high salary
the more money they earn,the less happy they are.

therefore , money doesn't means happiness.

### 17.5	part5（11）(60)
你更愿意跟哪种人工作：比较幽默 humourless 的人，还是比较严肃 seriousness 的人

I like to work with serious people. 
There are some advantages of serious people. 
First, they usually work hard and make no mistakes. 
Projects are more likely to succeed. 

Second: you can communicate effectively with them and 
they will usually give you clear points. 
This saves a lot of time. As we know, time is money.

### 18.5	part5（11）(60)
如果两个人在项目中出现分歧是要解决或是忽略？

My answer:

```
Yes, Of course, disagreements need to be resolved.

The disagreement mean thatsome information is  still  unclear,
Not to resolve it, will slow down the progress of the project. 
we may not meet the deadline, which means the project will fail.

I have led many projects, every successfull project has disagreement, 
i just resolved them as quickly as possible. 

Project members must have the same goals. cooperation is the key to success.
We can resolve any disagreement through communication.

These are the reasons why disagreements must be resolved.

education background and related work experience ,which one more important and why
你觉得对于一个新员工来说，是教育水平重要还是有相关经历重要（education or relevant work experience）
描述一个你熟悉的工作，如果要招聘一个新人，是教育背景重要还是行业经验更重要，理由和例子。

My answer:

```
it seems to me that it is more important to hire a employee
with a lot of relevant work experience.

that's because experience is important than education in many fields, 
i think education just gives you general knowledge about certain things,
but work experience means you know how to manage the specific things in your industry.

for example,if you are in the position of dealing with customer complains,
you can't learn through a textbook. 
but when you get practical experience handing real complaints, 
then you learn how to deal with customers more efficiently.

that's why i think relevant work experience is more essential when hiring employees.

```
My answer:

```
I think work experience is more important than education background. 
I have following reasons:
firstly, if someone has a good education background, it means he did a good job on the exam. 
But maybe he is not good at this job.  
However, if someone has a work experience, then he knows how to do this job.
Secondly, there are many good workers who didn’t graduate from college, but doing a good job. 
Not everyone can go to college, but anyone can work hard to become a good employee.   
Lastly, there are some important skills that you can’t learn at school. 
For example, communication, teamwork and so on. But they can be learned at work place. 
So, I think work experience is more important than education background. 
```

```
Story telling:
I think work experience is more important than education background.  
I have following reasons:
1.	You can’t learn some skills at school, for example communication and team work.
When I was at school, I was not a very sociable person. I didn’t want to talk to others. 
When I started working, I realized communication and team work is very important.
So, you learn those important skills when you are working.
2.	People from lower education background can become a great person. 
For example, Bill gates didn’t graduate from school, but he build up a great company like Microsoft. 
So education background is not so important, but how you work is important. 
so, I think work experience is more important than education background.

### 23.4	Part5 （60）新员工培养哪个重要
新员工培养，自己独立上手，还是 老员工帮忙辅导

I think the best way for training new employees is to teach them how to work independently.
There are three reasons.
Firstly, working independently will make them learn work skills quickly
and have a good comprehension of their job responsibility. 
Secondly, working independently is also a necessary ability,
actually we can't expect to rely on others’ help for everything. 
And finally, working independently will help them to build a resilient ability against work pressure. 
Therefore, it’s important to teach new employees how to work independently.
