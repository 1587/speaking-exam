有钱就会快乐吗？请给出理由。

My answer:

```
No, I don't think having money makes me happy.
Think about the past. When I was young, I had no money but I was very happy, 
I had many classmates, many friends, (many time), and i have no troubles.
so,we can see, The friendship makes people happy, 
but money can't buy real friendships.

In china, many software engineers work more than 12 hours a day
to maintain a high salary,
the more money they earn,the less happy they are.

so, money doesn't means happiness.
that's all.

education background and related work experience ,which one more important and why
你觉得对于一个新员工来说，是教育水平重要还是有相关经历重要（education or relevant work experience）
描述一个你熟悉的工作，如果要招聘一个新人，是教育背景重要还是行业经验更重要，理由和例子。

My answer1:

```
I think have a lot of relevant work experience is more important when hiring employees.

That's because in many fields, experience is more important than education,
I think education just gives you general knowledge about certain things,
but work experience means you know how to do the specific things in your industry.

for example,if you are in the position of dealing with customer complains,
you can't learn through a textbook. you must get practical experience by handing real complains.

that's all.
```

My answer2:

```

That's because in many fields, experience is more important than education,
I think education just gives you general knowledge about certain things,

for example,if you are in the position of dealing with customer complains,
you can't learn through a textbook. 
but when you get practical experience handing real complains, 
then you will learn how to deal with customer complains more efficiently.

that's why i think relevant work experience is more important when hiring employees.
