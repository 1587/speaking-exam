政府为所有学生承担大学课程费用的好处，举例支撑你的观点：
The advantages of pay the cost of university course for all students, pls give some examples to support it.
提供免费大学教育的优点包括：
首先，免费大学可以降低学生的债务，将使每一个学生都有机会上大学，无论学生的父母有多少钱。 这将有助于为低收入背景的学生加油打气。
此外，该国的整体教育水平可能会提高，从而使国家变得更好。
建议先明确一个论点，比如，减轻学生的经济负担，或学生的资金将可以更灵活地应用在学习中：一，钱可以用来买更高效先进的学习设备提升效率，比如PAD等；二，可以改善有经济压力（economical stressful）的学生经济状况，将更多的精力用于学习……

My answer:

```
if the government pay the cost of university courses for all students,
the quality of the country's education will be improved.

i have some reasons as follows:

firstly: students will have more money to buy study equipment,
such as ipad, computer or smartphone. they will study efficiently.
they can learn online courses at anywhere,
and disscuss with their classmates and teachers in time. 

secondly: students will focus on their study, don't worry about the money. 
don't spend much time on part time job.
they will have more time to learn knowledge.

thirdly: It gives everyone a chance to go to college, 
whether his family is poor or rich.



The more people get a college education,
the stronger the country will be. and it' education will develop very fast.

(finally: More people go to university and 
the quality of all citizens will be improved. 
we will have more safety public enviroment.)

All of the above are my views/opinions.

### 10.5	part5（11）(60)
问自己有一套房子或者公寓与租房的相比缺点是什么
买房子对比租房子的缺点，并描述认为是缺点的理由。

My answer:
``` 
I think buy a house will reduce the quality of my life.

Firstly, in china, the price of real estate is too high, it will cost much money. 
I will have no money for education, travel,medical care,and supporting the elderly. 
i will be a mortgage slave


Secondly, if I change my office to a place far from my house.
it's not convenient to work. 
I will waste much time to go to wook. and 

thirdly,I need to maintain the house every year, it's a waste of money and time.

finally, if the neighbors are not good,i can't change them. 
so i think ,rent a house is a good choice.
all the above are my opinions.
```

My answer2:
```
I think having a house or a department has the following disadvantages compared to renting:
First of all, housing is fixed in one place, cannot be changed at any time, 
But rental location can be changed with our work place,
making our work life more convenient.

Secondly, the economic pressure of housing is high, the quality of life is low. 
You know, in China, a house needs several million RMB,
and you have to pay off the loan every month, 
but the monthly rent is far less than the monthly mortgage [ˈmɔːɡɪdʒ].

Therefore, I like to rent a house, which can let my life without stress, and the mood happy.
```


My answer3:

```
There are some disadvantages of buying a house. 

Firstly, buying and maintaining a house costs a lot of money. 
Because house is very expensive to buy.
Besides, you have to decorate the house, buy furniture and many other things.

Secondly, it is difficult to move to different locations if you own a house. 
If you need to change your job, you need to move to a new location. 
But if you own a house, you can’t do that. 

So I think these are the disadvantages of buying a house.

有些人觉得人毕业后的第一份工作对他或她的后续职业有很大影响，你认可还是不认可，为什么？

My answer:

```
I don't think so. There are some reasons as follows.

Firstly: The most important thing for your career is the job that's right for you, 
not the first job, maybe the second one, the third one.

Secondly: When I was an interviewer, I did not care about the interviewee's first job,
I just care about their last job and their Work experience.

Thirdly: People often change their jobs nowadays. If you don't like you first job, 
you should change it as soon as possible. (it is nothing.)

(For example, When I graduated from college. My first job wasn't very good. 
I just switched jobs, and now I'm doing really well.)

For the above reasons, I think the first job is not that important.

### 13.5	part5（11）(60)
当你获得一个公司的offer时，你是否同意需要考虑这个公司的reputation

``` 
I think we need to think about the reputation of the company.

Firstly: If a company has a good reputation, 
it will have more business opportunities. Opportunity means money. 
(the company could provide a very good slary for the staff.)

Secondly: (If a company has a good reputation,) the employees will grow in the long run. 
then, company will develop very well. Become bigger and bigger.

Thirdly: If a company has a bad reputation, its employees won't be loyal to it. 
(they will leave the company one by one.) Sooner or later it will go bankrupt.

So, I think companies should do a lot to build a good reputation.

### 23.4	Part5 （60）新员工培养哪个重要
新员工培养，自己独立上手，还是 老员工帮忙辅导

I think the best way for training new employees is to teach them how to work independently.
There are three reasons.
Firstly, working independently will make them learn work skills quickly
and have a good comprehension of their job responsibility. 
Secondly, working independently is also a necessary ability,
actually we can't expect to rely on others’ help for everything. 
And finally, working independently will help them to build a resilient ability against work pressure. 
Therefore, it’s important to teach new employees how to work independently.
