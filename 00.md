you should change it as soon as possible. (it is nothing.)

(For example, When I graduated from college. My first job wasn't very good. I just switched jobs, and now I'm doing really well.)

当你获得一个公司的offer时，你是否同意需要考虑这个公司的reputation

``` 
I think we need to think about the reputation of the company.

Firstly: If a company has a good reputation, it will have more business opportunities. Opportunity means money. 
(It will provide a very good slary for its staff.)

Secondly: (If a company has a good reputation,) employees will grow in the long run. 
then, company will develop very well. Become bigger and bigger.

Thirdly: If a company has a bad reputation, its employees won't be loyal to it. 
(staff will leave the company one by one.) Sooner or later it will go bankrupt.

So, I think companies should do a lot to build a good reputation.

### 23.4	Part5 （60）新员工培养哪个重要
新员工培养，自己独立上手，还是 老员工帮忙辅导

I think the best way for training new employees is to teach them how to work independently.
There are three reasons.
Firstly, working independently will make them learn work skills quickly
and have a good comprehension of their job responsibility. 
Secondly, working independently is also a necessary ability,
actually we can't expect to rely on others’ help for everything. 
And finally, working independently will help them to build a resilient ability against work pressure. 
Therefore, it’s important to teach new employees how to work independently.
