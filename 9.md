比较难判断是哪里 – 可以说是outside view外景或者不说。左边一个女的用pad或者手机给很多人拍照。这些人在开心地小，后面有几间大房子，后面有很多书。阳光满眼，晴天。
```This is a close-up photo of the outside view. 
Many people，many buildings and many trees are in this photo. 
On the left, a young lady with an miniPad in her hands is taking photos for the people on the left. 
They smiles and looks like they are very happy. At the back there are many big houses. 
And behind the houses , there are many trees. 
There must be a big mountain behind. Today is a sunny date. Sunlight is very bright. ```
