13.5	part5（11）(60)
当你获得一个公司的offer时，你是否同意需要考虑这个公司的reputation
I think we need to consider about the reputation of this company.
The reputation is big deal for any business.
To achieve the highest level of success, the company must pay particular attention to its reputation.
If the company has good reputations, it will have more business opportunities, more customers and sales, and it will have great revenues.
So they will do a lot of things to build good reputation.
However, If the reputation is still negative, it candidates that the company could not be good enough.
So, I strongly recommend that you do this.
