大学生是否要利用空闲时间/长假期 去公司当实习生，为什么？

My answer:

```
Actually, I think there are some advantages about internship.
Firstly: You can get job experience in advance. then You will know clearly what you need to study in college.
Secondly: You can learn things that you can't study in school. You'll be better than your classmates.
At last,  You can earn money through internships, then you can buy more equipments or classes to improve your learning.
So, I think an internship is a better way to improve ourselves.
