最后一题是  未来几代是不是会比当前几代健康
Future generation will be more healthier than current generation
According my personal experience, I think people will be healthier in the future then they are now. There are some reason as follows:
Firstly, people are aware the health of their bodies now. For example, my colleague eat a little healthy food at dinner time every day.
Secondly, they run 3 kilometres at least every morning and evening to exercise the body.
The last one, they have given up many bad habits, such as somking and dringking.
To the reason above, I think people will be healthier in the future.

I think in the further, people will be healthier. 
Firstly, the medicine is becoming more and more developed so more diseases will be cured. Secondly, Life is being better so more and more people will do exercising to keep health. We can see now many young people like running, swimming and other sports.
Lastly, government and people pay more attention to environment protection which make our water and air cleaner.

我：1、健康生活-结出不良习惯  2、医学技术进步-人们少受疾病折磨 3、碳中和保障更少的环境污染和更多的树。所以下一代更健康
According to my experience， people in the future（ future generations）will be healthier due to the following three reasons.
Firstly, more healthier life in the future. People are getting rid of bad habits such as drinking, moking and staying up late.
Secondly, medical technologies are improved. People are selfdom suffered diseases through advanced medical care. People live longer than before.
Last by not least, carbon neutrality will make sure of less pollution to the environment and more trees in the wolrd.
So our new generation will be healthier. HZT 1016更新
